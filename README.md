We often discuss the following three topics.
1. the application of more pure functional languages like Haskell, OCaml in engineering practice.

2. the rational use of functional features of popular languages such as JavaScript, Python, Rust, etc.

3. the learning and use of proof assistants such as LEAN, Coq, and Agda.

In addition to these, we also welcome discussions on architecture, AI, Linux system optimization experience, and other topics.

Every month we will hold regular technical sharing sessions, where speakers from different schools and different knowledge backgrounds will bring their own topics of interest to you.

You can find the information about each session under this repository.

Whu Lambda welcomes you to join us!
